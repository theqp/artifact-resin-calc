# Artifact Resin Calculator

Implementation of [Estimated TBP](https://github.com/fribbels/hsr-optimizer/blob/0b2cd85501a20444694252b74f3d6c84462e7fac/docs/guides/en/stat-score.md#estimated-tbp) to Genshin.
Kudos to hsr-optimizer team, I just brainlessly ported it to Genshin.

Assumptions:
- 240 Trailblaze Power per day
- 1.065 relic drops per run
- 20% four line drops, 80% three line drops
- 20% correct part for relic sets
- Equal chance for 0.7 / 0.8 / 0.9 / 1.0 roll quality
- Main and sub stat probabilities in `estTpb.ts`
